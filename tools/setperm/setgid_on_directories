1) setuid on a directory

  The setuid permission set on a directory is ignored on UNIX and Linux systems.

2) setgid on a directory

  Setting the setgid permission on a directory (chmod g+s) causes new files and 
  subdirectories created within it to inherit its group ID, rather than the primary 
  group ID of the user who created the file (the owner ID is never affected, only 
  the group ID). Newly created subdirectories inherit the setgid bit. Thus, this 
  enables a shared workspace for a group without the inconvenience of requiring 
  group members to explicitly change their current group before creating new files 
  or directories. Note that setting the setgid permission on a directory only affects 
  the group ID of new files and subdirectories created after the setgid bit is set, 
  and is not applied to existing entities. Setting the setgid bit on existing 
  subdirectories must be done manually, with a command such as the following:

  [root@foo]# find /path/to/directory -type d | xargs chmod g+s
