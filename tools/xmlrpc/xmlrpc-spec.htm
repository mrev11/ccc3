This specification documents the XML-RPC protocol implemented in <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/">Frontier</a> 5.1. <p>

For a non-technical explanation, see <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1998/07/14/xmlRpcForNewbies">XML-RPC for Newbies</a>. <p>

This page provides all the information that an implementor needs.<p>

<b>Overview</b><p>

XML-RPC is a Remote Procedure Calling protocol that works over the Internet.<p>

An XML-RPC message is an HTTP-POST request. The body of the request is in XML. A procedure executes on the server and the value it returns is also formatted in XML.<p>

Procedure parameters can be scalars, numbers, strings, dates, etc.; and can also be complex record and list structures.<p>

<b>Request example</b><p>

Here's an example of an XML-RPC request:<p>

<pre>
POST /RPC2 HTTP/1.0
User-Agent: Frontier/5.1.2 (WinNT)
Host: betty.userland.com
Content-Type: text/xml
Content-length: 181<p>

&lt;?xml version="1.0"?>
&lt;methodCall>
   &lt;methodName>examples.getStateName&lt;/methodName>
   &lt;params>
      &lt;param>
         &lt;value>&lt;i4>41&lt;/i4>&lt;/value>
         &lt;/param>
      &lt;/params>
   &lt;/methodCall>
</pre><p>

<b>Header requirements</b><p>

The format of the URI in the first line of the header is not specified. For example, it could be empty, a single slash, if the server is only handling XML-RPC calls. However, if the server is handling a mix of incoming HTTP requests, we allow the URI to help route the request to the code that handles XML-RPC requests. (In the example, the URI is /RPC2, telling the server to route the request to the "RPC2" responder.)<p>

A User-Agent and Host must be specified. <p>

The Content-Type is text/xml. <p>

The Content-Length must be specified and must be correct.<p>

<b>Payload format</b><p>

The payload is in XML, a single &lt;methodCall> structure.<p>

The &lt;methodCall> must contain a &lt;methodName> sub-item, a string, containing the name of the method to be called. The string may only contain identifier characters, upper and lower-case A-Z, the numeric characters, 0-9, underscore, dot, colon and slash. It's entirely up to the server to decide how to interpret the characters in a methodName. <p>

For example, the methodName could be the name of a file containing a script that executes on an incoming request. It could be the name of a cell in a database table. Or it could be a path to a file contained within a hierarchy of folders and files.<p>

If the procedure call has parameters, the &lt;methodCall> must contain a &lt;params> sub-item. The &lt;params> sub-item can contain any number of &lt;param>s, each of which has a &lt;value>. <p>

<b>Scalar &lt;value>s</b><p>

&lt;value>s can be scalars, type is indicated by nesting the value inside one of the tags listed in this table:<p>

<table cellspacing=3 border=0>
<tr><td valign="top"><b>Tag</b></td><td valign="top" width="35%"><b>Type</b></td><td valign="top"><b>Example</b></td></tr><p>

<tr><td valign="top">&lt;i4> or &lt;int></td><td valign="top" width="35%">four-byte signed integer</td><td valign="top">-12</td></tr><p>

<tr><td valign="top">&lt;boolean></td><td valign="top">0 (false) or 1 (true)</td><td valign="top">1</td></tr><p>

<tr><td valign="top">&lt;string></td><td valign="top">ASCII string</td><td valign="top">hello world</td></tr><p>

<tr><td valign="top">&lt;double></td><td valign="top">double-precision signed floating point number</td><td valign="top">-12.214</td></tr><p>

<tr><td valign="top">&lt;dateTime.iso8601></td><td valign="top">date/time</td><td valign="top">19980717T14:08:55</td></tr><p>

<tr><td valign="top">&lt;base64></td><td valign="top">base64-encoded binary</td><td valign="top">eW91IGNhbid0IHJlYWQgdGhpcyE=</td></tr>
</table><p>

If no type is indicated, the type is string.<p>

<b>&lt;struct>s</b><p>

A value can also be of type &lt;struct>.<p>

A &lt;struct> contains &lt;member>s and each &lt;member> contains a &lt;name> and a &lt;value>. <p>

Here's an example of a two-element &lt;struct>:<p>

<pre>
&lt;struct>
   &lt;member>
      &lt;name>lowerBound&lt;/name>
      &lt;value>&lt;i4>18&lt;/i4>&lt;/value>
      &lt;/member>
   &lt;member>
      &lt;name>upperBound&lt;/name>
      &lt;value>&lt;i4>139&lt;/i4>&lt;/value>
      &lt;/member>
   &lt;/struct>
</pre><p>

&lt;struct>s can be recursive, any &lt;value> may contain a &lt;struct> or any other type, including an &lt;array>, described below.<p>

<b>&lt;array>s</b><p>

A value can also be of type &lt;array>.<p>

An &lt;array> contains a single &lt;data> element, which can contain any number of &lt;value>s.<p>

Here's an example of a four-element array:<p>

<pre>
&lt;array>
   &lt;data>
      &lt;value>&lt;i4>12&lt;/i4>&lt;/value>
      &lt;value>&lt;string>Egypt&lt;/string>&lt;/value>
      &lt;value>&lt;boolean>0&lt;/boolean>&lt;/value>
      &lt;value>&lt;i4>-31&lt;/i4>&lt;/value>
      &lt;/data>
   &lt;/array>
</pre><p>

&lt;array> elements do not have names. <p>

You can mix types as the example above illustrates.<p>

&lt;arrays>s can be recursive, any value may contain an &lt;array> or any other type, including a &lt;struct>, described above.<p>

<b>Response example</b><p>

Here's an example of a response to an XML-RPC request:<p>

<pre>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: close
Content-Length: 158
Content-Type: text/xml
Date: Fri, 17 Jul 1998 19:55:08 GMT
Server: UserLand Frontier/5.1.2-WinNT<p>

&lt;?xml version="1.0"?>
&lt;methodResponse>
   &lt;params>
      &lt;param>
         &lt;value>&lt;string>South Dakota&lt;/string>&lt;/value>
         &lt;/param>
      &lt;/params>
   &lt;/methodResponse>
</pre><p>

<b>Response format</b><p>

Unless there's a lower-level error, always return 200 OK.<p>

The Content-Type is text/xml. Content-Length must be present and correct.<p>

The body of the response is a single XML structure, a &lt;methodResponse>, which can contain a single &lt;params> which contains a single &lt;param> which contains a single &lt;value>.<p>

The &lt;methodResponse> could also contain a &lt;fault> which contains a &lt;value> which is a &lt;struct> containing two elements, one named &lt;faultCode>, an &lt;int> and one named &lt;faultString>, a &lt;string>.<p>

A &lt;methodResponse> can not contain both a &lt;fault> and a &lt;params>.<p>

<b>Fault example</b><p>

<pre>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: close
Content-Length: 426
Content-Type: text/xml
Date: Fri, 17 Jul 1998 19:55:02 GMT
Server: UserLand Frontier/5.1.2-WinNT<p>

&lt;?xml version="1.0"?>
&lt;methodResponse>
   &lt;fault>
      &lt;value>
         &lt;struct>
            &lt;member>
               &lt;name>faultCode&lt;/name>
               &lt;value>&lt;int>4&lt;/int>&lt;/value>
               &lt;/member>
            &lt;member>
               &lt;name>faultString&lt;/name>
               &lt;value>&lt;string>Too many parameters.&lt;/string>&lt;/value>
               &lt;/member>
            &lt;/struct>
         &lt;/value>
      &lt;/fault>
   &lt;/methodResponse>
</pre><p>

<b>Strategies/Goals</b><p>

<i>Firewalls.</i> The goal of this protocol is to lay a compatible foundation across different environments, no new power is provided beyond the capabilities of the CGI interface. Firewall software can watch for POSTs whose Content-Type is text/xml. <p>

<i>Discoverability.</i> We wanted a clean, extensible format that's very simple. It should be possible for an HTML coder to be able to look at a file containing an XML-RPC procedure call, understand what it's doing, and be able to modify it and have it work on the first or second try. <p>

<i>Easy to implement.</i> We also wanted it to be an easy to implement protocol that could quickly be adapted to run in other environments or on other operating systems.<p>

<b><a name="update1">Updated 1/21/99 DW</a></b><p>

The following questions came up on the UserLand <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/">discussion group</a> as XML-RPC was being implemented in Python. <ul><p>

<li>The Response Format section says "The body of the response is a single XML structure, a &lt;methodResponse>, which <i>can</i> contain a single &lt;params>..." This is confusing. Can we leave out the  &lt;params>?<p>

No you cannot leave it out if the procedure executed successfully. There are only two options, either a response contains a &lt;params> structure or it contains a &lt;fault> structure. That's why we used the word "can" in that sentence.<p>

<li>Is "boolean" a distinct data type, or can boolean values be interchanged with integers (e.g. zero=false, non-zero=true)? <p>

Yes, boolean is a distinct data type. Some languages/environments allow for an easy coercion from zero to false and one to true, but if you mean true, send a boolean type with the value true, so your intent can't possibly be misunderstood.<p>

<li>What is the legal syntax (and range) for integers? How to deal with leading zeros? Is a leading plus sign allowed? How to deal with whitespace? <p>

An integer is a 32-bit signed number. You can include a plus or minus at the beginning of a string of numeric characters. Leading zeros are collapsed. Whitespace is not permitted. Just numeric characters preceeded by a plus or minus.<p>

<li>What is the legal syntax (and range) for floating point values (doubles)? How is the exponent represented? How to deal with whitespace? Can infinity and "not a number" be represented? <p>

There is no representation for infinity or negative infinity or "not a number". At this time, only decimal point notation is allowed, a plus or a minus, followed by any number of numeric characters, followed by a period and any number of numeric characters. Whitespace is not allowed. The range of allowable values is implementation-dependent, is not specified.<p>

<li>What characters are allowed in strings? Non-printable characters? Null characters? Can a "string" be used to hold an arbitrary chunk of binary data? <p>

Any characters are allowed in a string except &lt; and &, which are encoded as &amp;lt; and &amp;amp;. A string can be used to encode binary data.<p>

<li>Does the "struct" element keep the order of keys. Or in other words, is the struct "foo=1, bar=2" equivalent to "bar=2, foo=1" or not? <p>

The struct element does not preserve the order of the keys. The two structs are equivalent.<p>

<li>Can the &lt;fault> struct contain other members than &lt;faultCode> and &lt;faultString>? Is there a global list of faultCodes? (so they can be mapped to distinct exceptions for languages like Python and Java)? <p>

A &lt;fault> struct <b>may not</b> contain members other than those specified. This is true for all other structures. We believe the specification is flexible enough so that all reasonable data-transfer needs can be accomodated within the specified structures. If you believe strongly that this is not true, please post a message on the discussion group.<p>

There is no global list of fault codes. It is up to the server implementer, or higher-level standards to specify fault codes.<p>

<li>What timezone should be assumed for the dateTime.iso8601 type? UTC? localtime? <p>

Don't assume a timezone. It should be specified by the server in its documentation what assumptions it makes about timezones.
